## Nonstop Chess ##

### The Game ###

**Nonstop Chess** takes the turns out of chess, transforming it into a
fast-paced strategy game of quick thinking rather than studious prediction.
There is a traditional chess board and pieces, but you don't wait on your
opponent to make a move. [Not yet implemented:] Each piece you move must then
sit in place for a period of time, but you are allowed to move as many different
pieces as rapidly as you want.

### Controls ###

You control the white pieces.

Click the piece you want to move, then click the space you want to move it to.
Obviously, you must obey the rules of chess with the movements.

Note that fancy moves like <i>en passant</i> and castling are not (yet)
implemented.

### The Technology ###

With the power of HTML, you can play Nonstop Chess right in your web browser! No
plugins or downloads.
