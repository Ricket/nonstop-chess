## Nonstop Chess ##

### The Game ###

**Nonstop Chess** takes the turns out of chess, transforming it into a fast-paced strategy game of quick thinking rather than studious prediction. There is a traditional chess board and pieces, but you don't wait on your opponent to make a move. Each piece you move must then sit in place for a period of time, but you are allowed to move as many different pieces as rapidly as you want.

### Controls ###

Each of your pieces has a two-letter combination (a bigram) next to it. This is how you command the piece. Type the two letters corresponding to a piece you want to move, then click the space you want to move to. Alternatively, you may click a piece you want to move and then click its destination; but the keyboard method is highly recommended in order to keep up your pace of moves to stand a chance against your opponent!

### The Technology ###

With the power of HTML, you can play Nonstop Chess right in your web browser! No plugins or downloads.
